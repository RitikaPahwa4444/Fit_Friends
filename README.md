# Fit Friends
## Motivation for the project
Right from the onset of the lockdown, most of the people were locked up in their homes. However, kids were affected the most. Not just their education was hampered, but their fitness levels also went down significantly. And this effect still prevails in their pedestrian lives. From obesity to backache, children are affected by many lifestyle-related diseases.So, in the wake of their deteriorating health, we have come up with ‘Fit Friends’, an android application to track the fitness levels of kids and motivate them to do some easy and quick exercises at regular intervals. They would be allowed to play a game each time they do some exercises as a reward!
